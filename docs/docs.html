<h2><a name="gettingstarted">Getting Started</a></h2>


<h3>Installing on Windows</h3>

To install GoGrinder on Windows, use the latest installer.  If you do not have 
the correct version of Java installed, GoGrinder will complain, and give you a 
link where you can download it.

<h3>Installing on other operating systems</h3>

GoGrinder requires Java version 1.4.2 or higher, so install it before installing GoGrinder.<p/>

If you are installing GoGrinder for the first time, unzip the full install zip file into a directory.<p/>

If you are upgrading, do not download the full install - this will overwrite 
your grind.dat file, and you will lose your settings.  Instead, download and 
unzip the upgrade file.<p/>

To run GoGrinder, go to the install directory, and execute the following command:<p/>

java -jar GoGrinder.jar<p/>

It's important that the current directory be set to the GoGrinder directory,
or the program will not be able to find the problem collections and other
data files.  Some Linux distributions will not set the current directory
correctly if you simply double-click the jar file to execute it.

<h2><a name="solvingproblems">Solving Problems</a></h2>

When you run GoGrinder for the first time, one of the problems that is 
installed with the program will be displayed.  To begin solving problems, just 
click at the location on the board where you want to play.  The indicator on 
the right will let you know whether you've gotten the problem right or not.  
When you get a problem right, GoGrinder will automatically advance to the next 
problem.  You can change this behavior in the 
<a href="#preferences">Preferences</a> dialog.  You can also right-click to go 
to the next problem, or use the keyboard shortcuts: Z (or comma) and X (or 
period) for previous and next.<p/>

You can use the buttons on the right to navigate within the problem.  Restart
will take you back to the beginning, and Back will move back to your previous 
move.  Navigate Solution will display right and wrong variations as red and 
green dots on the board, and will let you play out any variations that aren't in
the problem file, too.  After choosing Navigate Solution, you won't get 
credit for the problem.  You can still get the problem right after using Back 
or Restart, but only if you haven't deviated from the correct path.  Once you 
make a wrong move, you will not receive credit for getting the problem right.<p/>

When you shut GoGrinder down, it will keep track of where you are in the 
currently selected set of problems, and will pick up where you left off next 
time you run it.

<h3>Main Window</h3>


<table><tr><td><img src="SelProbs.png"/></td><td valign="center"><b>Select Problems</b></td></tr></table><p/>

See <a href="#selectingproblems">Selecting Problems</a>

<p/><table><tr><td><img src="Open.png"/></td><td valign="center"><b>Open File</b></td></tr></table><p/>

Opens a GoGrinder state file.  See "Save Progress", below.

<p/><table><tr><td><img src="Save.png"/></td><td valign="center"><b>Save Progress</b></td></tr></table><p/>

This can be used to save your progress through a set of problems.  The problems 
you have selected, the sort order, and your current progress through the set are 
saved.  Note that you do not need to do this when closing the program - 
GoGrinder will pick up where you left off automatically.  This is mainly useful 
when you are halfway through a set of problems, and you want to go work on a 
different set and come back to the current set later.

<p/><table><tr><td><img src="Edit.png"/></td><td valign="center"><b>Edit Current Problem</b></td></tr></table><p/>

Edits the current problem in an external SGF editor.  The SGF editor is configured in
the <a href="#preferences">Preferences</a> dialog.

<p/><table><tr><td><img src="PrevProb.png"/></td><td valign="center"><b>Previous Problem</b></td></tr></table><p/>

Takes you back to the previous problem.  This will not affect your stats on the 
current problem - it will not count as right or wrong, as long as you haven't 
made any wrong moves yet.  You can also go to the previous problem by pressing 
Z or comma on the keyboard.

<p/><table><tr><td><img src="NextProb.png"/></td><td valign="center"><b>Next Problem</b></td></tr></table><p/>

Takes you to the next problem.  This will not affect your stats on the current 
problem - it will not count as right or wrong, as long as you haven't made any 
wrong moves yet.  You can also go to the next problem by right-clicking, or by 
pressing X or . on the keyboard.

<p/><table><tr><td><img src="Find.png"/></td><td valign="center"><b>Find Problem</b></td></tr></table><p/>

Allows you to find a problem by entering part of its name.  This is useful for
jumping to a certain problem in the currently selected list of problems.

<p/><table><tr><td><img src="AutoAdv.png"/></td><td valign="center"><b>Auto Advance</b></td></tr></table><p/>

If activated, the next problem will automatically be displayed when you find a 
correct solution.  You can also advance to the next problem by right-clicking 
on the board, or use the keyboard shortcuts: Z (or comma) and X (or period) for 
previous and next.

<p/><table><tr><td><img src="Prefs.png"/></td><td valign="center"><b>Preferences</b></td></tr></table><p/>

See <a href="#preferences">Preferences</a></h4>

<a name="Split"></a><p/><table><tr><td><img src="Split.png"/></td><td valign="center"><b>Split SGF File</b></td></tr></table><p/>

Sometimes SGF files will contain many game records/problems.  To use these 
files with GoGrinder, you need to split them up so that each file contains one 
problem.  To do this, choose "Split SGF File", select the file to split, and 
then select the directory where you want the individual files to be placed - 
probably somewhere inside of the GoGrinder/problems directory.

<p/><table><tr><td><img src="Import.png"/></td><td valign="center"><b>Import Problems</b></td></tr></table><p/>

Imports problems that have been exported from GoGrinder.  This imports the SGF 
files and any tags that have been associated with the problems.  If a different 
version of the problem already exists in your collection, you will be asked if 
you wish to overwrite the existing problem.  If the problem exists, and you 
continue with the import, the tags from the import file will be merged with the 
tags on the existing copy.

<p/><table><tr><td><img src="About.png"/></td><td valign="center"><b>About</b></td></tr></table><p/>

Displays version and license information.

<p/><table><tr><td><img src="Help.png"/></td><td valign="center"><b>Help</b></td></tr></table><p/>

Displays this document.

<h4>Restart</h4>

Restarts the current problem.  This will not count as getting the problem wrong, 
as long as you haven't made any wrong moves yet.

<h4>Back</h4>

Takes back your latest move.  This will not count as getting the problem wrong, 
as long as you haven't made any wrong moves yet.  You can also go back by using
the mousewheel.

<h4>Navigate Solution</h4>

Displays all of the variations in the problem.  Moves on the correct path are 
marked with green dots, bad moves that have refutations are marked with red.  
While navigating the solution, you can also play out variations that are not 
included in the problem file. Choosing this option means that you can no longer 
get credit for solving the problem.

<h4>Stats</h4>

Displays how many of the currently selected problems you have attempted, and 
what percentage you have answered correctly.

<h4>Tags</h4>

Tags are a way of organizing your problem collection.  You can apply tags to 
certain problems, and then search for problems by the tags they are associated 
with.  "Apply tag..." allows you to associate a tag with the current problem, 
and you can choose "New Tag..." from the drop-down to create a new tag.  The 
list box shows tags that are associated with the current problem, and the Remove 
button allows you to remove tags from the current problem.

<h4>Status Bar</h4>

The status bar at the bottom of the main window displays the filename for the 
current problem.

<h2><a name="selectingproblems">Selecting Problems</a></h2>

To select problems, click the Select Problems button on the toolbar of the main 
window.  All of your problem collections will be displayed, and you will be able 
to choose the collections you want to work on, and filter and sort the problems 
in various ways.

<h4>Collections</h4>

Allows you to select one or more collections of problems.

<h4>Apply Tag</h4>

Applies a tag to every problem in the currently selected collections.

<h4>Reset Stats</h4>

Resets statistics on every problem in the currently selected collections. This 
does not affect tags, but resets # of attempts, # of times correct, and average 
time.

<h4>High Scores</h4>

Displays the high scores for the selected collection.  The high scores are 
ranked by % correct, and then by average time per problem.  Whenever you attempt 
every problem in a collection without changing your selection in the middle, you 
are eligible for a high score.  You can also get a high score for a higher-level 
collection that contains multiple folders, by selecting the higher-level 
collection, and working through all of its problems.  Your progress through a 
collection is saved between sessions, so you don't have to solve all of the 
problems in a collection in one sitting to get a high score.

<h4>Tags</h4>

Allows you to filter the selected problems by their associated tags.  You can 
select one or more tags from the list, and they are used to filter the problems 
as specified in the Match combo box.

<h4>Delete</h4>

Removes the selected tags from all of your problems.

<h4>Match</h4>

You have three choices: All Tags means only problems associated with all of the 
selected tags will be chosen, Any Tags means problems associated with any of the 
selected tags will be chosen, and No Tags means only problems that are not 
associated with any of the selected tags are chosen.

<h4>Export...</h4>

Allows you to export the currently selected problems to file.  This file can 
then be imported by another GoGrinder user.  The export file contains the 
problem SGF files and associated tags.  Statistics and high scores are not 
exported.

<h4>OK</h4>

Finalizes the problem selection.  This resets the statistics for the selected 
problems, and lets you start solving problems.

<h4>Cancel</h4>

Cancels the problem selection.  The current selection remains as it was before 
the selection dialog opened, and statistics are not reset.

<h2><a name="preferences">Preferences</a></h2>

<h4>Automatically advance to next problem</h4>

When checked, the next problem will automatically be displayed when you find a 
correct solution.  You can also advance to the next problem by right-clicking on 
the board, or use the keyboard shortcuts: Z (or comma) and X (or period) for 
previous and next.

<h4>Randomly rotate/flip problems</h4>

When checked, GoGrinder randomly changes the orientation of the problems on the 
board.  This may make the comments in some problems confusing.

<h4>Randomly swap colors</h4>

When checked, GoGrinder randomly swaps the colors of the problems.  This also 
changes all occurrences of the words "white" and "black" in the problem's 
comments.

<h4>Display transparent stone at cursor position</h4>

When checked, a transparent stone is displayed on the board at the cursor position.

<h4>Display 'Failed' at first mistake</h4>

When checked, the status area will change to 'Failed' as soon as you make a 
wrong move.  Otherwise, it will only change when you reach the end of a wrong 
variation.

<h4>Enable stone sound</h4>

Turns on/off the sound of the stone hitting the board.

<h4>Enable right/wrong sounds</h4>

Turns on/off the sounds that are played when you get a problem right or wrong.

<h4>SGF Editor</h4>

Selects an external SGF editor for editing problems.

<h4>Check for newer version at startup</h4>

If this is checked, GoGrinder will let you know when a new version is available.

<h4>Proxy Settings</h4>

These settings are used to check for a new version of GoGrinder.  If you use a
proxy to connect to the internet, enter your settings here.

<h2><a name="fileformat">File Format</a></h2>

Problems for GoGrinder should be stored in SGF format.  There are two ways of 
indicating which moves are correct.  The first is to put either "RIGHT" or 
"CORRECT" somewhere in the comment of the correct node.  This is the format used 
at goproblems.com.  All paths that do not lead to a node with one of these 
comments are considered incorrect.  The words "RIGHT", "CORRECT", and "CHOICE" 
will not be displayed in the comment area.  The other way is used if there are 
none of these comments in the file.  In this case all moves in the file are 
considered correct, unless the variation is marked with the non-standard SGF 
tag WV[], or the stone that was just played is marked with a triangle.

<h2><a name="uninstalling">Uninstalling</a></h2>

<h3>Uninstalling in Windows</h3>

You can uninstall GoGrinder from the Add/Remove Programs applet in the Windows 
control panel, or from the icon in the GoGrinder program group.  The uninstaller 
will not remove your problem collections or statistics.  To completely remove 
GoGrinder, you will have to remove these by hand.

<h3>Uninstalling on other operating systems</h3>

Simply delete the directory where you installed GoGrinder.
